# odin-weather-app
This is the weather app project from TOP(the odin project) Full Stack JavaScript course.

This project is about building a weather app using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

The website will consist of a main html index page, a css page and javascript page.

By the end of the project, I will have demonstrated skills in setting up a website using my knowledge around JavaScript and Asynchronous coding.

Self-reflection and conclusion: 

This project was an excellent opportunity to practice asynchronous coding and API's call and data extraction, manipulation.
